## Introduction:
> We propose for our group project to implement and test the Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) search algorithm in Python, in the context of the multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms Cooperative A* and Conflict-Based Search (CBS). We aim to combine, refine, and extend our individual projects on MAPF by modularizing the single-agent planner component to work with both A* (original) and SIPP (our new implementation) algorithms. After implementing SIPP, we would like to test/benchmark the resultant program under the four combinations of (A*, SIPP) x (Coop-A*, CBS) on a battery of test instances, which would include instances given in the individual assignment and instances that we have crafted.
> We hope to answer questions about which combination of planner and multi-agent path finder gives the fastest result in different classes of instances (and if there even are significant differences between the classesâ€™ results), and also to compare the amount of nodes expanded and memory used by each one. Some of these instance classes which we can use to categorize results are # of agents, crowded vs sparse, and/or number of obstacles in the map. We would also like to discover whether suboptimal solutions occur with A* and not SIPP, and vice versa. 

## To-Do List:
1. ~~Setup working environment, with basic MAPF working(with space_time A* & CBS set up)~~
2. ~~Get Coop A* to run as Multi agent path finder.~~
3. ~~Get CBS to run as multi agent path finder.~~
4. Get basic A* to run as single agent planner.
5. Turn pseudo SIPP into python SIPP, get it to run as a single agent planner.
6. A* with Cooperative A*
7. A* with CBS
8. SIPP with Cooperative A*
9. SIPP with CBS
10. Yield result. With # of nodes, time taken, memories used, h(n) used, # of agents, obstacles in mind, write report to attempt to explain the differences in these results.


## Findings:
### Prioritized Planning Space Time A* (Left) VS SIPP (Right)

> Case 1: Given same map, same number of agent, same obstacle, same goal, the path taken is exactly the same.

> Case 2: Given same map, same # of agents, same obstacles, same goal, the path taken are different. Prioritized Planning Space Time A* moves Agent 1 out of the way for Agent 0, while SIPP just lets Agent 1 sit still, resulting in a collision.
