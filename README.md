##Introduction:
> We propose for our group project to implement and test the Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) search algorithm in Python, in the context of the multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms Cooperative A* and Conflict-Based Search (CBS). We aim to combine, refine, and extend our individual projects on MAPF by modularizing the single-agent planner component to work with both A* (original) and SIPP (our new implementation) algorithms. After implementing SIPP, we would like to test/benchmark the resultant program under the four combinations of (A*, SIPP) x (Coop-A*, CBS) on a battery of test instances, which would include instances given in the individual assignment and instances that we have crafted.
> We hope to answer questions about which combination of planner and multi-agent path finder gives the fastest result in different classes of instances (and if there even are significant differences between the classesâ€™ results), and also to compare the amount of nodes expanded and memory used by each one. Some of these instance classes which we can use to categorize results are # of agents, crowded vs sparse, and/or number of obstacles in the map. We would also like to discover whether suboptimal solutions occur with A* and not SIPP, and vice versa. 

##To-Do List:
1. Setup working environment, with basic MAPF working(with space_time A* & CBS set up)
2. Get Coop A* to run as Multi agent path finder. 
3. get CBS to run as multi agent path finder. 
4. Get basic A* to run as single agent planner.
5. Turn pseudo SIPP into python SIPP, get it to run as a single agent planner.
6. Yield result. With # of nodes, time taken, memories used, h(n) used, # of agents, obstacles in mind, write report to attempt to explain the differences in these results.
